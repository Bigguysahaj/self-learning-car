## Whats New: (11th october) ⚜️
## Eyes of the car!

* Car now has proximity sensors on it
* The sensors can (for the time being) visually represent the intersections of road boarder and rays
* This method is often implemented in video games often under the name of ray tracing, not just for shadows but actual game implementations

* Here's the very useful getIntersection function, wrote from scratch. This would come very handy when we start teaching the car to nagvigate through the road itself (and in future traffic).

* We also added another js file (sensors.js) which holds all the code for it.

* The camera now follows the car in a bird eye view perspective.
* The car trully seems to being moving because of the animated roads.
* We only used save(), restore() and translate() function to do this.
* The website is now deployed on https://self-learning-car.vercel.app/
